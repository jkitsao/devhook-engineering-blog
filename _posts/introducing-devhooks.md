### Hey, Iâ€™m Kitsao ðŸ‘‹

Building **Devhooks**, a better way to work with webhooks and events.

Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve worked on multiple projects where webhooks played a huge role, from payments and notifications to integrations with third-party APIs. Debugging and testing them, however, has always beenâ€¦ painful.

At **MyMovies.Africa**, I built a video encoding pipeline and a custom webhook system to emit real-time events about encoding jobs. Later, at **Old Mutual**, I managed dozens of webhook integrations powering M-Pesa paybills and other payment workflows. Today, as a consultant, I work on microfinance integrations with **Apache Fineract**, where events and webhooks are once again central to connecting systems seamlessly.

### Comparing Daraja and Stripe

Working with webhooks in Kenya naturally brings Daraja into the conversation. Daraja, M-Pesaâ€™s API platform, provides webhook notifications for transactions, which are essential for real-time updates in payment workflows. It covers the basics well but has some limitations compared to platforms like Stripe.

Stripe, on the other hand, treats webhooks as a first-class feature. It provides a robust dashboard, detailed event logs, automatic retries, and rich event types covering payments, subscriptions, and refunds. These features make it easier for developers to debug, test, and manage webhooks without building additional tooling.

Understanding these differences has influenced how I design webhook systems. With Devhooks, the goal is to combine the simplicity of Daraja with the observability and reliability features found in platforms like Stripe, making webhook integrations smoother and more predictable for developers everywhere.

### Devhooks in Action

With **Devhooks**, you donâ€™t need to worry about building or managing complex infrastructure for webhooks. The **Devhooks Debugger** lets you inspect and test webhooks without needing tools like ngrok. Meanwhile, **Devhooks Ingest** handles observability, scaling, queues, and retries for you, all in a clean, intuitive dashboard. You can explore it here: [devhooks.live/ingest](https://devhooks.live/ingest).

One of the standout features is **Devhooks Sync**, which turns your webhook events into real-time streams. Using a simple SDK, you can surface these events directly in your apps â€” for example, in a **Next.js** application. This makes it easy to build real-time experiences, like handling M-Pesa **STK Express** payments, without worrying about the underlying plumbing.
