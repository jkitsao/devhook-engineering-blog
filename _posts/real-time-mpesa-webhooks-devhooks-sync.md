## Turning M-Pesa Webhooks into Real-Time Event Streams

Handling M-Pesa STK Push webhooks can be tricky. Normally, the webhook hits your backend, and your frontend has to **poll repeatedly or refresh** to check if a payment went through. Itâ€™s slow, clunky, and frustrating for users.

With **Devhooks Sync**, I built a solution that takes care of the heavy lifting for you. First, we **ingest the webhook on your behalf**, so you donâ€™t have to deal with Daraja callbacks directly. Then, each payload is turned into a **live event stream** your frontend can subscribe to. No polling. No delays. Instant updates.

If youâ€™re curious about the technical details and want to DIY using Cloudflare Durable Objects, I wrote a [step-by-step guide here](https://blog.devhooks.live/posts/mpesa-cloudflare-durable-reactive). But Devhooks Sync abstracts all that complexity so you can focus on your users.

### How It Works

1. **Webhook Ingestion:** Devhooks receives the M-Pesa STK Push payload from Daraja.
2. **Event Stream:** Each payload is converted into a live event in a stream.
3. **Frontend Subscription:** Your client subscribes to the stream and receives updates immediately when payments succeed or fail.

Itâ€™s like giving your frontend a **direct phone line to M-Pesa**. Users see payment confirmations instantly, no spinning loading screens, no double payments, no frustration.

### Why This Matters

If youâ€™ve ever experienced the frustrating refresh-button dance with movie tickets on KenyaBuzz or waiting for payments at supermarkets like Naivas, you know how slow and unreliable the old workflow can be. [I wrote about it in detail here](https://blog.devhooks.live/posts/reactive-mpesa-stk-webhooks).

With Devhooks Sync:

- **Instant Feedback:** Payments update in real-time.
- **Safer Transactions:** Users act on accurate information immediately.
- **Simpler Frontend:** Your client just subscribes; Devhooks handles the rest.

### Bringing It All Together: Frontend Made Simple

Once the backend is set up with Devhooks Sync on top of Cloudflare Durable Objects, I wanted to make the frontend experience **truly effortless**. Developers can just plug in a client without worrying about Durable Objects, authentication flows, or managing connections.

Hereâ€™s an example using the `@jkitsao/echo` client in a Next.js app:

![Devhooks Sync Frontend Connection](/assets/blog/devhooks-sync-mpesa/frontend-connection.jpeg)

```javascript
"use client";

import { SyncClient } from "@jkitsao/echo";
import { useEffect } from "react";

export default function Page() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const client = new SyncClient({
      sourceId: "frontend-app",
      secret: "supersecret",
    });

    client.on("authenticated", () => {
      console.log("âœ… Authenticated!");
      client.send({ type: "hello", msg: "from Next.js" });
    });

    client.on("event", (data) => {
      console.log("ðŸ“© Event received:", data);
    });

    client.connect();

    return () => client.disconnect();
  }, []);

  return <div>Echo Client Running...</div>;
}
```

With just a few lines, your frontend:

- Authenticates securely with the Devhooks backend.

- Sends messages to the server.

- Receives real-time events as soon as M-Pesa payloads arrive.

We've used Devhooks to turn webhooks from a delayed, manual process into a seamless, reactive experience, letting your users see payments instantly while keeping your frontend code clean and simple
